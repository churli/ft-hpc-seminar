\section{Examples} \label{sec:examples}
% [\TODO Here I could actually report, in a more detailed way, an example of how resource awareness was achieved on HPX: e.g. by reporting task grain size adaptivity by Grubel \cite{grubel2016dynamic}]

% [\TODO Here ideally report on how cfd-lab was ported to HPX]

[\TODO Here add a couple of easy examples on how to parallelize using HPX tasks and an example on how to read a performance counter].
